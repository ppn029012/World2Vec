# World2Vec
Natural Language can not be understood well by computer, the main reason of it is that the computer can not understand the world behind the text. Therefore, the only way we can bring the concious understanding is to create a virtual world for computer, where it can read, learn and predict, and understand.

**World2Vec** Project is a plan to map the real world to a vector, which will finally help the computer understand the language and the world.
